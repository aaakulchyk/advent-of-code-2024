# Advent of Code 2024

This is my first time participating in the Advent of Code. Shoutout to [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/theprimeagen)
for advertising it as a means to learn new programming languages. I'm going to use this year's
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) to learn Zig and probably refresh my C++
knowledge.

Hopefully, I will go through the first 5-10 days at least.

## Run Commands

Navigate to a folder corresponding a particular day of the Advent and execute one of the following commands depending on the desired source language.

### Zig

```
zig run solution.zig
```

### C++

```
g++ -std=c++20 solution.cpp -o solution
solution
```
